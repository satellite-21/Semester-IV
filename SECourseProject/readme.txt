This is the readme file for the project Notebit.

NoteBit is a basic react based web application to store personalised notes 
which comes up with a simple authentication system to store the notes.

We can start the application by going in the 'app' directory and giving command '>npm start'. This will start the 
react application.

This command will lead us to the authentication layer, where your username and password will be asked. The loop 
will continue until and unless correct password and username are not provided. 

Once the correct username and password are entered, the window will lead to the main window consisting of the user's
personalised notes. 

The dashboard will appear with {Username}'s Personal Assisstant written on it. The Bluish box wil be present which
will ask the user to enter the notes. One can enter the notes there and click the save button to add notes.

The note section will ask for three things namely, "Heading", "Text", "Deadline". Heading contains the title of the
note. Text will contain the body of the note and deadline will tell the deadline set by the user.

To delete the note, one can simply click the delte button and delete the note.

So basically 2-3 features were provided like addNote, Authentication, deleteNote, Deadline, etc.

Finally, this is how the NoteBit works and reduces the burden of the shoulders of the human beings.
